# CFET_fp

## Overview

This project offers standard cells generated by *CFET_fp*, which utilizes a search-tree based approach for transistor placement combined with multi-row-aware folding and an SMT-based in-cell routing. 

The cells are developed using the [ASAP7 PDK library](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/asap7).

## Architecture and Standard Cell Information
We have created three sets of CFET cell libraries: (1) 2-track multi-row, (2) 3-track multi-row, and (3) 4-track single-row.

The rules for each CFET cell library are outlined below:

* Rules for (1) and (2):
```
Minimum area rule (MAR) = 1
End-of-line (EOL) = 1
Via rule (VR) = 0
Parallel run length (PRL) = 1
Step height rule (SHR) = 2
Minimum pin length (MPL) = 1(for (1)), 2(for (2))
Minimum pin opening (MPO) = 1
```

* Rules for (3)
```
Minimum area rule (MAR) = 1
End-of-line (EOL) = 2
Via rule (VR) = 1
Parallel run length (PRL) = 1
Step height rule (SHR) = 2
Minimum pin length (MPL) = 2
Minimum pin opening (MPO) = 1
```

The following 30 cells have been generated:
