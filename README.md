# CFET_fp

## Overview

This project offers standard cells generated by *CFET_fp*, which utilizes a search-tree based approach for transistor placement combined with multi-row-aware folding and an SMT-based in-cell routing. 

The cells are developed using [ASAP7 PDK library](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/asap7).

## Architecture and Standard Cell Information
We have created five sets of CFET cell libraries: (1) 2-track multi-row, (2) 3-track single-row, (3) 4-track single-row, (4) 3-track multi-row, and (5) 4-track multi-row.

The rules for each CFET cell library are outlined below:

* Rules for (1) and (2):
```
P-FET on N-FET
Minimum area rule (MAR) = 1
End-of-line (EOL) = 1
Via rule (VR) = 0
Parallel run length (PRL) = 1
Step height rule (SHR) = 2
Minimum pin length (MPL) = 1(for (1)), 2(for (2))
```

* Rules for (3):
```
P-FET on N-FET
Minimum area rule (MAR) = 1
End-of-line (EOL) = 2
Via rule (VR) = 1
Parallel run length (PRL) = 1
Step height rule (SHR) = 2
Minimum pin length (MPL) = 2
```

* Rules for (4) and (5):
```
Bidrectional M1 routing (without no BEOL DRC violations)
P-FET on N-FET
Minimum area rule (MAR) = 1
End-of-line (EOL) = 2
Via rule (VR) = 1
Parallel run length (PRL) = 1
Step height rule (SHR) = 2
Minimum pin length (MPL) = 1(for (4)), 2(for (5))
```
